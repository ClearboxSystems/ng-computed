# ng-computed

Computed properties for [AngularJS][1], Ã  la [Knockout JS][2].

## Summary

`ng-computed` lets you write computed properties without worrying
about which values to register a `$watch` on and when.

```javascript
$scope.string = "hello";
$scope.$computed('computedValue', function() {
    return $scope.$eval('string') + " world!";
});
```

In this case, `$scope.computedValue` will take on the value `"hello
world!"`, while also reacting to changes to `$scope.string`. While
this case is almost trivial, the more complex cases are made more
complex only by the complexity of the computing function.

## Setup

At the top level we can add our functions to the root scope, even
going so far as to replace the functions there:

```javascript
angular.module('app', ['ngComputed', 'ng'])
    .run(['$rootScope', '$trackedEval', '$computed', function($rootScope, $trackedEval, $computed) {
        $rootScope.$eval = $trackedEval;
        $rootScope.$computed = $computed;
    }]);
```
For the majority of the documentation we will assume this setup,
although it is also possible to bind to different names on the root
scope, or to bind these values on any sub-scope.

## Average use

For an average use case there shouldn't be much need to think
particularly hard about how you write computed properties. Just write
a function to calculate the value from other values on the scope,
using `$eval` to read from the scope instead of doing so yourself.

As a relatively meaningless example:

```javascript
$scope.$computed('computedValue', function() {
    switch ($scope.$eval('operation')) {
    case 'addition':
        return $scope.$eval('add1') + $scope.$eval('add2');
    case 'subtraction':
        return $scope.$eval('sub1') - $scope.$eval('sub2');
    case 'multiplication':
        return $scope.$eval('mul1') * $scope.$eval('mul2');
    case 'division':
        if ($scope.$eval('div2') == 0) {
            return null;
        } else {
            return $scope.$eval('div1') / $scope.$eval('div2');
        }
    }
});
```

From this, `ng-computed` will work out all the details of what needs
to be watched, and when. So, if `$scope.operation == "division"` and
`scope.div2 == 0` then you'll only have watches registered on those
two values, but if `scope.div2 != 0` then you'll have three watches:
`scope.operation`, `scope.div1` and `scope.div2`.
